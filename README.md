# remocolab
remocolab is a Python module to allow remote access to [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) using SSH or [TurboVNC](https://www.turbovnc.org/).
It also install [VirtualGL](https://www.virtualgl.org/) so that you can run OpenGL programs on a Google Colaboratory machine and see the screen on VNC client.
It secures TurboVNC connection using SSH port forwarding.

## Requirements
- You can use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)
  - That means you need Google acount and a browser that is supported by Google Colaboratory.
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) Tunnel Authtoken
  - You need to sign up for ngrok to get it
- SSH client
- (Optional) TurboVNC Viewer if you use it.

## How to use
1. Create a new notebook on Google Colaboratory
2. Add a code cell and copy & paste one of following codes to the cell

- SSH only:
```python3
!pip install git+https://github.com/demotomohiro/remocolab.git
import remocolab
remocolab.setupSSHD()
```

- SSH and TurboVNC:
```python3
!pip install git+https://github.com/demotomohiro/remocolab.git
import remocolab
remocolab.setupVNC()
```

3. (Optional) If you want to run OpenGL applications or any programs that use GPU,
Click "Runtime" -> "Change runtime type" in top menu and change Hardware accelerator to GPU.
4. Run that cell
5. Then the message that ask you to copy & paste tunnel authtoken of ngrok will appear.
Login to ngrok, click Auth on left side menu, click Copy, return to Google Colaboratory, paste it to the text box under the message and push enter key.
   - You can also specify ngrok token to ``remocolab.setupSSHD()`` or ``remocolab.setupVNC()`` in the code like ``remocolab.setupSSHD(ngrok_token = NGROK_TOKEN_VALUE)``.
6. Select your ngrok region. Select the one closest to your location. For example, if you were in Japan, type jp and push enter key.
   - You can also specify ngrok region to ``remocolab.setupSSHD()`` or ``remocolab.setupVNC()`` in the code like ``remocolab.setupSSHD(ngrok_region = "jp")``.
7. remocolab setup ngrok and SSH server. Please wait for it done (about 2 minutes)
8. Then, root and colab user password and ssh command to connect the server will appear.
9. Copy & paste the ssh command to your terminal and login to the server using displayed colab user password.
(Even if you just want to use TurboVNC, you need to login using SSH to make SSH port forwarding)

* If you use TurboVNC:
10. Wait for remocolab setup TurboVNC (about 2 minutes)
11. When VNC password is displayed, run TurboVNC viewer on your local machine, set server address to ``localhost:1`` and connect.
12. Then, password will be asked. Copy & paste that VNC password to your TurboVNC viewer.

## How to run OpenGL applications
Put the command to run the OpenGL application after ``vglrun``.
For example, ``vglrun firefox`` runs firefox and you can watch web sites using WebGL with hardware acceleration.

## How to setup public key authentication
By using public key authentication, you can login to ssh server without copy&pasting a password.
If you don't have an SSH key pair, generate it with ssh-keygen:
```console
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521
```
Add following code after ``remocolab.setupSSHD()`` or ``remocolab.setupVNC()``,
and replace "my public key" in following code with your public key.
```python3
!mkdir /home/colab/.ssh
with open("/home/colab/.ssh/authorized_keys", 'w') as f:
  f.write("my public key")
!chown colab /home/colab/.ssh /home/colab/.ssh/authorized_keys
!chmod 700 /home/colab/.ssh
!chmod 600 /home/colab/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
If you want to login as root, use following code:
```python3
!mkdir /root/.ssh
with open("/root/.ssh/authorized_keys", 'w') as f:
  f.write("my public key")
!chmod 700 /root/.ssh
!chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
And replace user name colab in ssh command to root.

## Experimental kaggle support
remocolab in kaggle branch works on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
1. Create a new Notebook with Python language.
2. Set settings to:
   - Internet on
   - Docker to Latest Available
   - GPU on if you use TurboVNC
3. Add a code cell and copy & paste one of following codes to the cell

- SSH only:
```python3
!pip install git+https://github.com/demotomohiro/remocolab.git@kaggle
import remocolab
remocolab.setupSSHD()
```

- SSH and TurboVNC:
```python3
!pip install git+https://github.com/demotomohiro/remocolab.git@kaggle
import remocolab
remocolab.setupVNC()
```

4. Follow instructions from step 4 in above "How to use".
